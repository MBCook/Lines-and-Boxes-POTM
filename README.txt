My entry for the early 2006 Program of the Month competition, designed to play lines and boxes. I worked on this in my final semester at college, and decided to play around with genetic algorithms. Theory.txt explains how the genetics are supposed to work. There are two DNA files (testDNA and best.dna) you can play with. 

The temp directory contains the output of a run of the program. I don't remember what.

The new directory contains the output of another run of the program, including the results.html file that showed how well the various bits of DNA did against each other. I don't remember what was different between the copy of master.c in this directory and the copy in the project core.

I didn't use source control during this project, unfortunately.
